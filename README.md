<h1>Learn All The Things</h1>
<br>
<p> Fully realizing that HTML is not *all the things*, it is part of the process. So here I am, currently in the <a href= "https://learnenough.com">Learn Enough&trade; HTML to Be Dangerous</a> course figuring this stuff out so that I can figure more stuff out later.
<br>
<br>
<br>
I learned tags, formatting, linking, adding images, creating nav menus and pages, and a little bit of CSS. The result is rough, as I went slightly rogue and haven't come back to actually make this site look nice, but it does have some pretty images and links to cool associations that support the Appalachian Trail and the Pacific Crest trail.
